## Phase 3: Full Ability System - ðŸ”² Planned

**Goal:** Expand to all 8 deities with complete ability sets and visual effects.

### Planned Tasks

- [ ] **Hotkey-based ability activation system**
  - Replace command-based activation (`/ability use`) with hotkey binding
  - Single equipped ability slot (player can only have 1 ability equipped at a time)
  - Hotkey to activate equipped ability (default: R or configurable)
  - Ability equip/swap GUI or command (`/ability equip <ability_id>`)
  - Swap cooldown system (prevent rapid ability switching mid-combat)
  - Swap cooldown duration: 30-60 seconds (configurable)
  - Visual indicator showing currently equipped ability in HUD
  - Persistent equipped ability (saved with player data)
  - Equip validation (must own deity, meet rank requirements)
  - Clear feedback when trying to activate with no equipped ability

- [ ] **All 8 deities implemented**
  - Morthen (Death) - 4 abilities
  - Aethra (Light) - 4 abilities
  - Umbros (Shadows) - 4 abilities
  - Tharos (Storms) - 4 abilities
  - Gaia (Earth) - 4 abilities
  - Vex (Madness) - 4 abilities

- [ ] **Complete ability sets**

  - Unique mechanics per deity theme
  - Balanced cooldowns and costs
  - Synergies within deity ability sets

- [ ] **Visual effects**
  - Particle effects for ability activation

  - Animation hooks where applicable

- [ ] **Devotion progression**
  - Rank-specific ability unlocks
  - Enhanced effects at higher ranks
  - Rank titles and visual indicators
  - Rank-based favor multipliers

### Design Notes

- Each deity should have a unique playstyle identity
- Abilities should synergize with deity themes
- Visual clarity important for PvP readability
- Balance across all 8 deities

**Hotkey System Design Considerations:**
- Single equipped ability forces strategic choice (can't use all 4 at once)
- Swap cooldown prevents ability cycling during combat
- Encourages pre-planning: equip the right ability for the situation
- Rewards player skill: knowing when to swap vs when to commit
- PvP balance: opponents can predict equipped ability from combat patterns
- Suggested swap cooldown: 45 seconds (balance between flexibility and commitment)

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**New Systems Needed:**

1. **AbilitySlotManager.cs**
   - Track currently equipped ability per player
   - Validate equip requests (deity ownership, rank requirements)
   - Persist equipped ability to PlayerDeityData
   - Provide getter for equipped ability ID

2. **AbilitySwapCooldownManager.cs**
   - Track last ability swap timestamp per player
   - Enforce swap cooldown (default: 45 seconds, configurable)
   - Persist swap cooldown across server restarts
   - Provide remaining cooldown calculation

3. **Hotkey Registration**
   - Register ability activation hotkey (client-side)
   - Default binding: R key
   - Send network packet to server on hotkey press
   - Server validates and executes equipped ability

4. **HUD Updates**
   - Add equipped ability display to FavorHudElement
   - Show ability name, icon (if available), and cooldown
   - Visual indication when swap cooldown is active
   - Update display on ability equip/swap

5. **Network Protocol**
   - Client â†’ Server: "Activate equipped ability" packet
   - Client â†’ Server: "Equip ability" packet with ability ID
   - Server â†’ Client: "Equipped ability updated" packet
   - Server â†’ Client: "Swap cooldown active" error packet

6. **Data Model Updates**
   - Add `EquippedAbilityId` to PlayerDeityData
   - Add `LastAbilitySwapTime` to PlayerDeityData or separate manager
   - Ensure persistence on save/load

7. **Command Updates**
   - Deprecate `/ability use <ability_id>` (keep for testing/admin)
   - Add `/ability equip <ability_id>` command
   - Add `/ability equipped` command to show current
   - Update `/ability list` to highlight equipped ability
