## Phase 3 (OLD): Full Ability System - ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED

> **‚ö†Ô∏è This phase has been cancelled and replaced with the new Phase 3: Religion-Based Deity System with Perk Trees**
> The active ability system from Phases 1-2 will be removed in favor of passive perk trees tied to a custom religion system.
> See the new Phase 3 section below for the updated design.

**Original Goal:** Expand to all 8 deities with complete ability sets and visual effects.

### Planned Tasks

- [ ] **Hotkey-based ability activation system**
  - Replace command-based activation (`/ability use`) with hotkey binding
  - Single equipped ability slot (player can only have 1 ability equipped at a time)
  - Hotkey to activate equipped ability (default: R or configurable)
  - Ability equip/swap GUI or command (`/ability equip <ability_id>`)
  - Swap cooldown system (prevent rapid ability switching mid-combat)
  - Swap cooldown duration: 30-60 seconds (configurable)
  - Visual indicator showing currently equipped ability in HUD
  - Persistent equipped ability (saved with player data)
  - Equip validation (must own deity, meet rank requirements)
  - Clear feedback when trying to activate with no equipped ability

- [ ] **All 8 deities implemented**
  - Morthen (Death) - 4 abilities
  - Aethra (Light) - 4 abilities
  - Umbros (Shadows) - 4 abilities
  - Tharos (Storms) - 4 abilities
  - Gaia (Earth) - 4 abilities
  - Vex (Madness) - 4 abilities

- [ ] **Complete ability sets**
  - 32 total abilities (8 deities √ó 4 abilities)
  - Unique mechanics per deity theme
  - Balanced cooldowns and costs
  - Synergies within deity ability sets

- [ ] **Visual effects**
  - Particle effects for ability activation
  - Visual indicators for buffs/debuffs
  - Deity-themed color schemes
  - Animation hooks where applicable

- [ ] **Devotion progression**
  - Rank-specific ability unlocks
  - Enhanced effects at higher ranks
  - Rank titles and visual indicators
  - Rank-based favor multipliers

### Design Notes

- Each deity should have a unique playstyle identity
- Abilities should synergize with deity themes
- Visual clarity important for PvP readability
- Balance across all 8 deities

**Hotkey System Design Considerations:**
- Single equipped ability forces strategic choice (can't use all 4 at once)
- Swap cooldown prevents ability cycling during combat
- Encourages pre-planning: equip the right ability for the situation
- Rewards player skill: knowing when to swap vs when to commit
- PvP balance: opponents can predict equipped ability from combat patterns
- Suggested swap cooldown: 45 seconds (balance between flexibility and commitment)

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**New Systems Needed:**

1. **AbilitySlotManager.cs**
   - Track currently equipped ability per player
   - Validate equip requests (deity ownership, rank requirements)
   - Persist equipped ability to PlayerDeityData
   - Provide getter for equipped ability ID

2. **AbilitySwapCooldownManager.cs**
   - Track last ability swap timestamp per player
   - Enforce swap cooldown (default: 45 seconds, configurable)
   - Persist swap cooldown across server restarts
   - Provide remaining cooldown calculation

3. **Hotkey Registration**
   - Register ability activation hotkey (client-side)
   - Default binding: R key
   - Send network packet to server on hotkey press
   - Server validates and executes equipped ability

4. **HUD Updates**
   - Add equipped ability display to FavorHudElement
   - Show ability name, icon (if available), and cooldown
   - Visual indication when swap cooldown is active
   - Update display on ability equip/swap

5. **Network Protocol**
   - Client ‚Üí Server: "Activate equipped ability" packet
   - Client ‚Üí Server: "Equip ability" packet with ability ID
   - Server ‚Üí Client: "Equipped ability updated" packet
   - Server ‚Üí Client: "Swap cooldown active" error packet

6. **Data Model Updates**
   - Add `EquippedAbilityId` to PlayerDeityData
   - Add `LastAbilitySwapTime` to PlayerDeityData or separate manager
   - Ensure persistence on save/load

7. **Command Updates**
   - Deprecate `/ability use <ability_id>` (keep for testing/admin)
   - Add `/ability equip <ability_id>` command
   - Add `/ability equipped` command to show current
   - Update `/ability list` to highlight equipped ability

## Phase 3: Religion-Based Deity System with Perk Trees - ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS (~60% Complete)

**Goal:** Transform the mod from player-centric active abilities to religion-centric passive perk trees.

### Executive Summary

This is a **fundamental redesign** that moves deity assignment from individual players to custom player-created religions. The active ability system is completely replaced with passive perk trees that unlock based on dual ranking systems.

**See [phase3_group_deity_perks_guide.md](phase3_group_deity_perks_guide.md) and [phase3_task_breakdown.md](phase3_task_breakdown.md) for complete design specifications and implementation tasks.**

### Key Changes

1. **Custom Religion System**: Players create and join custom religions (not using VS built-in groups)
2. **Single Religion Per Player**: Players can only be in one religion at a time
3. **Religion-Based Deity**: A religion chooses a deity, and all members serve that deity
4. **Passive Perk Trees**: Replace active abilities with passive perks
5. **Dual Ranking**:
   - **Player Favor Ranks**: Individual progression (Initiate ‚Üí Disciple ‚Üí Zealot ‚Üí Champion ‚Üí Avatar)
   - **Religion Prestige Ranks**: Collective progression (Fledgling ‚Üí Established ‚Üí Renowned ‚Üí Legendary ‚Üí Mythic)
6. **160 Unique Perks**: Each deity has 2 perk trees with 20 perks each (10 player perks + 10 religion perks)

- ‚ùå Perk Tree Viewer (visual perk tree with unlock status) - Phase 3.5
- ‚úÖ Enhanced HUD (religion name, deity, both ranks, favor/prestige display)

**Content (Partially Complete):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3/8 deities with complete perk trees (Khoras, Lysa, Morthen)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 30/80 player perks implemented (37.5%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 30/80 religion perks implemented (37.5%)
- ‚úÖ Public/private religion system
- ‚úÖ Invitation system
- ‚úÖ Religion switching with 7-day cooldown

### Design Principles

- **Community Focus**: Encourage player cooperation through religions
- **Meaningful Choice**: Religion choice is significant due to switching penalties
- **Long-term Progression**: Perks persist and accumulate over time
- **Strategic Depth**: Perk choices and combinations create unique builds
- **Deity Identity**: Each deity has unique perk themes and playstyles

### Technical Notes

- **Single Religion Enforcement**: Simpler than multi-religion, prevents exploits
- **Custom Implementation**: Not using Vintage Story's built-in groups for full control
- **O(1) Deity Lookup**: Single religion per player enables fast deity determination
- **Cooldown System**: 7-day cooldown on religion switching prevents abuse

- **Migration Path**: Existing Phase 1-2 saves auto-migrate to new format

### Timeline

**Original Estimate**: 10-12 weeks (121-154 hours)

**Completed**:
- Phase 3.1: ‚úÖ ~16-22 hours (Foundation)
- Phase 3.2: ‚úÖ ~10-12 hours (Ranking Systems)
- Phase 3.3: ‚úÖ ~17-21 hours (Perk System Core)

**In Progress**:
- Phase 3.4: ‚ö†Ô∏è ~14-18 hours completed / 38-48 hours total (37.5% - Deity Perk Trees)

**Remaining**:
- Phase 3.4: ~24-30 hours (5 remaining deities + balance testing)
- Phase 3.5: ~40-51 hours (Integration & Polish)

**Total Progress**: ~60% complete (~73-92 hours completed, ~48-62 hours remaining)

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **5 Deities Incomplete** - Aethra, Umbros, Tharos, Gaia, Vex need 100 perks (62.5% of content)
2. **No GUI** - All interaction is command-based (need PerkTreeDialog and ReligionManagementDialog)
3. **Special Effects Incomplete** - Stat modifiers work, but special handlers needed (lifesteal, poison, etc.)
4. **In-Game Testing Pending** - Stat application just implemented, needs verification
5. **No Balance Testing** - Blocked until all deities complete

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. In-game testing of Phase 3.3 stat application system
2. Complete remaining 5 deity perk definitions (100 perks)
3. Implement special effect handlers for complex perk mechanics
4. Balance testing with all 8 deities
5. Begin Phase 3.5 (UI development and polish)
