# Favor Progression Time Calculations

## Current System (Lifetime Favor Thresholds)

- **Initiate:** 0 favor (starting rank)
- **Disciple:** 500 favor
- **Zealot:** 2,000 favor
- **Champion:** 5,000 favor
- **Avatar:** 10,000 favor

## Passive Favor Generation Rates

### Base Rate
- **0.5 favor per in-game hour** (no multipliers)

### With Devotion Rank Multipliers

As you progress, your passive favor gain increases:

| Devotion Rank | Multiplier | Favor per Hour |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Initiate | 1.0x | 0.5 |
| Disciple | 1.1x | 0.55 |
| Zealot | 1.2x | 0.6 |
| Champion | 1.3x | 0.65 |
| Avatar | 1.5x | 0.75 |

### With Religion Prestige Multipliers

Additional bonus based on your religion's prestige rank:

| Prestige Rank | Additional Multiplier | Combined Example (Initiate) |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Fledgling | 1.0x | 0.5 favor/hour |
| Established | 1.1x | 0.55 favor/hour |
| Renowned | 1.2x | 0.6 favor/hour |
| Legendary | 1.3x | 0.65 favor/hour |
| Mythic | 1.5x | 0.75 favor/hour |

## Time to Reach Each Rank (Passive Only)

### Scenario 1: Solo Player (No Religion Bonuses)

Passive favor rate increases as you rank up due to devotion multipliers.

#### Initiate → Disciple (500 favor)
- Rate: 0.5 favor/hour
- **Time: 1,000 in-game hours**
- Real-time (24hr days, 20min each): **~333 hours (~14 days)**

#### Disciple → Zealot (1,500 more favor needed)
- Rate: 0.55 favor/hour (Disciple multiplier)
- **Time: 2,727 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~909 hours (~38 days)**

- **Real-time: ~5,473 hours (~228 days of continuous play)**

### Scenario 2: Active Religion Member (Mythic Prestige)

With maximum religion prestige bonus (1.5x multiplier).

#### Initiate → Disciple
- Rate: 0.5 × 1.5 = 0.75 favor/hour
- **Time: 667 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~222 hours (~9 days)**

#### Disciple → Zealot
- Rate: 0.55 × 1.5 = 0.825 favor/hour
- **Time: 1,818 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~606 hours (~25 days)**

#### Zealot → Champion
- Rate: 0.6 × 1.5 = 0.9 favor/hour
- **Time: 3,333 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~1,111 hours (~46 days)**

#### Champion → Avatar
- Rate: 0.65 × 1.5 = 0.975 favor/hour

#### Total Time (Initiate → Avatar, With Religion Bonus)
- **Total: 10,946 in-game hours**
- **Real-time: ~3,649 hours (~152 days of continuous play)**

### Scenario 3: With Activity Bonuses (Realistic Play)

Assuming you optimize with activity bonuses (prayer, sacred territory, etc.):
- Average effective multiplier: **2.0x** (prayer bonus averaged over time)

#### Initiate → Disciple
- Rate: 0.75 × 2.0 = 1.5 favor/hour
- **Time: 333 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~111 hours (~5 days)**

#### Disciple → Zealot
- Rate: 0.825 × 2.0 = 1.65 favor/hour
- **Time: 909 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~303 hours (~13 days)**

#### Zealot → Champion
- Rate: 0.9 × 2.0 = 1.8 favor/hour
- **Time: 1,667 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~556 hours (~23 days)**

#### Champion → Avatar
- Rate: 0.975 × 2.0 = 1.95 favor/hour
- **Time: 2,564 in-game hours**
- Real-time: **~855 hours (~36 days)**

#### Total Time (Initiate → Avatar, Optimized)
- **Total: 5,473 in-game hours**
- **Real-time: ~1,824 hours (~76 days of continuous play)**

## Combined with PvP

PvP kills provide 10-20 favor each (depending on deity relationships).

### Example: Moderate PvP Player

Assumptions:
- 2 PvP kills per real-time hour (moderate activity)
- Average 15 favor per kill (mix of rival/neutral kills)
- = 30 favor/hour from PvP
- Plus passive (let's say 0.75 favor/hour base with religion bonus)
- **Total: ~31 favor per real-time hour**

#### Initiate → Disciple (500 favor)
- **Time: ~16 real-time hours**

#### Disciple → Zealot (1,500 favor)
- **Time: ~48 real-time hours**

#### Zealot → Champion (3,000 favor)
- **Time: ~97 real-time hours**

#### Champion → Avatar (5,000 favor)
- **Time: ~161 real-time hours**

#### Total (Initiate → Avatar, With PvP)
- **Total: ~322 real-time hours (~13 days of play)**

### Example: Hardcore PvP Player

Assumptions:
- 5 PvP kills per real-time hour (very active)
- Average 18 favor per kill (targeting rivals)
- = 90 favor/hour from PvP
- Plus passive (~1.5 favor/hour with bonuses)
- **Total: ~91.5 favor per real-time hour**

#### Initiate → Avatar (10,000 favor)
- **Time: ~109 real-time hours (~4.5 days of play)**

## Summary Tables

### Passive Only Progression (In-Game Hours)

| From Rank | To Rank | Favor Needed | Solo (1.0x) | Religion (1.5x) | Optimized (2.0x avg) |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Initiate | Disciple | 500 | 1,000 | 667 | 333 |
| Disciple | Zealot | 1,500 | 2,727 | 1,818 | 909 |
| Zealot | Champion | 3,000 | 5,000 | 3,333 | 1,667 |
| Champion | Avatar | 5,000 | 7,692 | 5,128 | 2,564 |
| **TOTAL** | **Initiate → Avatar** | **10,000** | **16,419** | **10,946** | **5,473** |

### Passive Only Progression (Real-Time Hours)

Based on 20-minute in-game days (72 in-game hours per real hour):

| From Rank | To Rank | Solo | Religion | Optimized |
|-----------|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| Initiate | Disciple | 333 hrs (14 days) | 222 hrs (9 days) | 111 hrs (5 days) |
| Disciple | Zealot | 909 hrs (38 days) | 606 hrs (25 days) | 303 hrs (13 days) |
| Zealot | Champion | 1,667 hrs (69 days) | 1,111 hrs (46 days) | 556 hrs (23 days) |
| Champion | Avatar | 2,564 hrs (107 days) | 1,709 hrs (71 days) | 855 hrs (36 days) |
| **TOTAL** | **Initiate → Avatar** | **5,473 hrs (228 days)** | **3,649 hrs (152 days)** | **1,824 hrs (76 days)** |

### With PvP (Real-Time Hours)

| Player Type | Kills/Hour | Favor/Hour | Time to Avatar |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Passive Only (optimized) | 0 | 1.5 | 1,824 hours |
| Casual PvP | 1 | 16.5 | 164 hours (7 days) |
| Moderate PvP | 2 | 31 | 87 hours (4 days) |
| Active PvP | 5 | 91.5 | 30 hours (1.5 days) |
| Hardcore PvP | 10+ | 180+ | 15 hours (0.6 days) |

## Balance Analysis

### Current Issues with Passive-Only

**Too Slow:**
- 228 days of continuous play to reach Avatar (solo, passive only)
- Even with optimization: 76 days continuous play
- Most players won't sustain this

**Recommendations:**

1. **Increase Base Passive Rate**
   - Current: 0.5 favor/hour
   - Proposed: **2.0 favor/hour**
   - This 4x increase brings solo passive to ~57 days continuous play
   - With optimizations: ~19 days continuous play
   - More reasonable for dedicated non-PvP players

2. **Add More Favor Sources**
   - Deity-specific quests: 50-100 favor each
   - Daily activities: 10-20 favor per day
   - Shrine offerings: 25 favor per offering
   - Exploration/discovery: 15-30 favor per discovery

3. **Keep PvP as Primary**
   - PvP should still be 5-10x faster than passive
   - Passive provides fallback for low-population or peaceful play
   - Mixed playstyle (some PvP + passive) is ideal target

## Revised Calculations (2.0 Base Favor/Hour)

### Passive Only, Optimized (2.0 base × 2.0 activity avg = 4.0/hour)

| From Rank | To Rank | In-Game Hours | Real-Time Hours |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Initiate | Disciple | 250 | 83 hrs (~3.5 days) |
| Disciple | Zealot | 682 | 227 hrs (~9.5 days) |
| Zealot | Champion | 1,250 | 417 hrs (~17 days) |
| Champion | Avatar | 1,923 | 641 hrs (~27 days) |
| **TOTAL** | **Initiate → Avatar** | **4,105** | **1,368 hrs (~57 days)** |

### With Even Casual PvP (1 kill/hour + 4.0 passive)

Average favor per hour: 15 (PvP) + 4 (passive) = 19/hour

| Progression | Real-Time Hours |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Initiate → Avatar | **~143 hours (~6 days)** |

**This feels much more balanced!**

## Final Recommendations

### Proposed Passive Rates

```
Base: 2.0 favor per in-game hour
Devotion multipliers: 1.0x / 1.1x / 1.2x / 1.3x / 1.5x
Religion multipliers: 1.0x / 1.1x / 1.2x / 1.3x / 1.5x
Activity bonuses: 1.5x - 2.0x average with optimization
```

### Target Progression Times

| Player Type | Time to Avatar | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Passive Only (no optimization) | ~95 days | Casual, infrequent player |
| Passive Optimized | ~57 days | Dedicated non-PvP player |
| Casual PvP (1 kill/hr) | ~6 days | Light PvP engagement |
| Moderate PvP (2-3 kills/hr) | ~3-4 days | Active player |
| Hardcore PvP (5+ kills/hr) | ~1-2 days | Very active PvP focus |

These times assume continuous play. Actual calendar time will be longer based on play sessions.

## Conversion Reference

**In-Game Time to Real-Time:**
- 1 in-game day = 24 in-game hours = 20 real minutes
- 1 in-game hour = 50 real seconds
- 72 in-game hours = 1 real hour
- 1,728 in-game hours = 1 real day (24 hours)
- 51,840 in-game hours = 1 real month (30 days)
