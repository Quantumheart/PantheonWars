## Ability Balance Philosophy

### Design Principles

1. **Power vs Cost**
   - More impactful abilities cost more favor
   - AoE effects more expensive than single target
   - Team buffs more expensive than self buffs

2. **Cooldown vs Impact**
   - Basic utility: 20-30 seconds
   - Moderate impact: 30-45 seconds
   - High impact: 45-60 seconds

3. **Rank Gating**
   - Initiate: Basic abilities, learn the deity
   - Disciple: Advanced abilities, mastery begins
   - Higher ranks (future): Enhanced versions

4. **Counterplay**
   - All abilities have weaknesses
   - Timing and positioning matter
   - No "I win" buttons
