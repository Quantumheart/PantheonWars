## Summary

### Total Estimated Time: 10-12 weeks

**Phase 3.1**: 16-22 hours (Week 1-2) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Phase 3.2**: 10-12 hours (Week 3) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Phase 3.3**: 17-21 hours (Week 4-5) ✅ **COMPLETED** (except stat application)
**Phase 3.4**: 38-48 hours (Week 6-8) ⚠️ **37.5% COMPLETED** (3/8 deities, 60/160 perks)
**Phase 3.5**: 40-51 hours (Week 9-10) ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Grand Total**: ~121-154 hours

### Task Count: 200+ individual tasks

### Critical Path
1. Data models must be created first
2. ReligionManager depends on data models
3. PlayerReligionDataManager depends on ReligionManager
4. Commands depend on both managers
5. Perk system depends on both data models and managers
6. UI depends on all backend systems being complete

### Recommended Approach
- Complete each phase fully before moving to next
- Test thoroughly at each phase boundary
- Keep Phase 3 branch separate until fully tested
- Consider alpha/beta testing phases between major phases

---

## Notes

- All time estimates are approximate and may vary based on experience
- Some tasks can be done in parallel (e.g., different deity perk implementations)
- Testing time may increase if bugs are discovered
- UI work may take longer depending on Vintage Story GUI complexity
- Perk effect implementations may vary widely in complexity
- Balance testing should be iterative throughout Phase 3.4

## Current Phase Status Summary

### Phase 3.1 Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed Tasks:**
- All data models created with protobuf serialization
- ReligionManager system fully implemented
- PlayerReligionDataManager system fully implemented
- All 10 religion commands implemented
- PantheonWarsSystem integration complete
- Persistence fully functional

### Phase 3.2 Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed Tasks:**
- ReligionPrestigeManager fully implemented
- PvP favor/prestige earning integrated
- Rank-up notifications working (chat-based)
- FavorHudElement displaying all religion and favor data
- Network synchronization via PlayerReligionDataPacket

**Minor Gaps:**

**Completed Tasks:**
- PerkRegistry system with 160 perks registered
- PerkEffectSystem calculating stat modifiers
- Comprehensive unlock validation
- Perk persistence working
- All 7 perk commands implemented
- Perk system infrastructure complete

**⚠️ CRITICAL GAP:**
- `PerkEffectSystem.ApplyPerksToPlayer()` is a placeholder
- Stat modifiers are calculated but **NOT actually applied to player stats in-game**
- Perks unlock successfully but have no gameplay effect yet

### Phase 3.4 Status: ⚠️ 37.5% COMPLETED (60/160 perks)
**Completed Deities:**
- ✅ Khoras (War) - 20 perks fully designed and implemented
- ✅ Lysa (Hunt) - 20 perks fully designed and implemented
- ✅ Morthen (Death) - 20 perks fully designed and implemented

**Remaining Deities (100 perks):**
- ❌ Aethra (Light) - Empty stub, 0/20 perks
- ❌ Umbros (Shadows) - Empty stub, 0/20 perks
- ❌ Tharos (Storms) - Empty stub, 0/20 perks
- ❌ Gaia (Earth) - Empty stub, 0/20 perks
- ❌ Vex (Madness) - Empty stub, 0/20 perks

**⚠️ CRITICAL GAP:**
- Perk effects defined but not actually applied to gameplay
- No special effect handlers implemented (lifesteal, poison, etc.)
- Balance testing blocked until effects work

### Phase 3.5 Status: ❌ NOT STARTED
**Pending Tasks:**
- Remove old ability system
- Data migration for old saves
- Perk tree visualization UI (PerkTreeDialog)
- Religion management UI (ReligionManagementDialog)

---

## Overall Assessment: ~60% Complete

**What Works:**
- Religion system fully functional
- Favor/Prestige progression working
- Perk unlocking and persistence working
- All commands working
- HUD displaying data
- Network sync working

**Critical Blockers:**
1. **Perks don't affect gameplay** - ApplyPerksToPlayer needs implementation
2. **5 deities incomplete** - 62.5% of perks (100/160) need design and implementation
3. **No GUI** - All interaction is command-based
4. **No balance testing** - Can't test until perks actually work

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement `ApplyPerksToPlayer()` to make perks functional
2. Complete remaining 5 deity perk definitions (Aethra, Umbros, Tharos, Gaia, Vex)
3. Implement special effect handlers (lifesteal, poison_dot, critical_strike, etc.)
4. Balance testing with functional perks
5. Begin Phase 3.5 UI and polish work
