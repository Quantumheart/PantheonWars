# Documentation Update: Sync README and Implementation Guide with Phase 3 Progress

## Overview

This PR updates both `README.md` and `implementation_guide.md` to accurately reflect the current state of Phase 3 development. The documentation was significantly out of date, showing the project as "Planned" when it's actually 60% complete with substantial working systems.

## Problem

**Before this PR:**
- Implementation guide showed Phase 3 as "üî≤ Planned (0/5)"
- README claimed version v0.1.0 with only Phase 1 features
- No mention of religion system, dual ranking, or perk trees
- Commands section missing 17 new commands
- Project structure didn't reflect Phase 3 files

**Reality:**
- Version v0.3.5 (Phase 3.3 Complete)
- Phase 3 is 60% complete with 3.5/5 sub-phases done
- Core systems fully functional (religion, ranking, perks)
- 60/160 perks implemented (3/8 deities complete)
