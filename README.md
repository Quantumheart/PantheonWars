# Pantheon Wars

**Version:** 1.0.0-beta

A religion-based PvP mod for Vintage Story featuring custom religions, competing deities, and passive blessing trees with dual progression systems.

## Overview

Pantheon Wars introduces a comprehensive religion and deity worship system where players create or join custom religions dedicated to different gods. Each religion unlocks unique passive blessing trees that enhance all members. Players earn individual Divine Favor and collective Religion Prestige through PvP combat, unlocking powerful blessings and progressing through dual ranking systems.

- **Visual Blessing Tree:** No GUI blessing tree viewer yet. Use `/blessings tree` command for text-based view.
- **Old Ability System:** Phase 1-2 ability system still exists but will be removed in a future patch.

**What Works Perfectly:**
- All stat modifier bonuses (damage, health, armor, speed, attack speed, walk speed, etc.)
- Religion creation, management, and progression
- Blessing unlocking and persistence
- Dual ranking system (Favor + Prestige)
- All 17 commands
- Religion Management GUI
