# Pantheon Wars

A religious-themed PvP mod for Vintage Story featuring competing deities with unique abilities and a favor-based progression system.

## Overview

- **Devotion Ranks**: Progress from Initiate to Avatar (5 ranks)
- **Deity Relationships**: Allied and rival deity dynamics affect favor gain

### Ability System
- **4 Abilities per Deity**: Each with unique mechanics and playstyles
- **Cooldown Management**: Balanced ability usage with strategic timing
- **Visual Effects**: Particle effects and animations for abilities

### PvP Features
- **Divine Duels**: Formal 1v1 challenges with favor stakes
